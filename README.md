# CuddleCraze (Prototype Phase)

## Description

Where Every Pet Finds a Hug, and Every Heart Finds a Friend.

CuddleCraze is a brand new application to help people make connections via mankind's best friend. Whether you're a dog owner who needs to re-home their beloved pet, or a would-be adopter looking to welcome a new best friend into your life, CuddleCraze is there for you.

We allow users to list dogs that need re-homing in our Doggie Database, providing forms to cataglogue their age, breed, special requirments etc. Adopters can then scroll through this database, filtering it by location or breed, to find a dog to suit what they and their family can provide. Dogs can be marked as reserved once they've found a new home, and users can even save dogs to their favourites.

Each dog has its own dynamically-created page with their information and even a random dog fact, for fun!

We also provide an email service allowing users to make enquiries about their chosen dog, connecting users whilst also maintaining internet privacy

# Demo

## Usage

The site has two main functions.

- Adopting a dog

By clicking Adopt in the navbar, the user will be taken to our doggie database, filling with dynamically-created cards of all the dogs in our system. Using filters at the top of the page, the user can refine their search by breed or location. Clicking on the dog card will take them to the dog's profile page, with all their information, a dog video on how to take care of that particular breed, and an email form they can use to contact us, requesting us to connect them with their chosen dog's current owner

- Listing a dog

If a user makes an account, they can then list an animal they wish to re-home. Clicking on the Account tab on the Navbar will take you to your personal page. From there, click a button called 'Add Pet', which will prompt you for information about your dog. Submit, and your dog will be added to our database!
